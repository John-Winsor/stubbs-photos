# stubbs-photos

The Stubbs are related to me and are part of my extended family.  This website is a photographic archive of family photos from the 1930's intended for their personal interest.  It is unlikely to interest anyone-else.

In order to minimise the consumption of Github memory, all the displayed photos are stored in Google Drive.
